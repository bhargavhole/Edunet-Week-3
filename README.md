# Edunet-Week-3

✅ What You Have Done in This Project

✅ Imorted and explored the dataset (Rainfall.csv)

✅ Performed Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Encoded categorical features (if any)
Scaled/normalized data for model training

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized rainfall trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn
Checked correlations between features
Identified class imbalance in target labels

✅ Dealt with Imbalanced Data
Used RandomOverSampler from imblearn to balance the dataset

✅ Built and Trained Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression
XGBoost Classifier
SVC

✅ Evaluated Model Performance
Accuracy Score
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Confusion Matrix for detailed prediction analysis

✅ Compared Models to check which performed better
